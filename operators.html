    /></a>Drivers want to know car park availability before they arrive at
    the car park. With&nbsp;<span class="appname">ParkJam</span>, they can, and you can make it even better.</p>

    <div class="wide">
        <p><span class="appname">ParkJam</span> primarily gets parking
        availability information from its users, but car park owners such as
        cities, employers, and private car park operators, can make sure
        their car parks are well covered. Drivers will appreciate it.</p>
        
        <p>We have car park locations from <a
        href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>, but if your car
        parks are missing, you can easily add them in <span
        class="appname">ParkJam</span>. We also have bits of information
        about car parks (e.g. parking fees, opening hours etc.) and again,
        you can easily add or fix them.</p>
