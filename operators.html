    /></a>Drivers want to know car park availability before they arrive at
    the car park. With&nbsp;<span class="appname">ParkJam</span>, they can, and you can make it even better.</p>

    <div class="wide">
        <p><span class="appname">ParkJam</span> is a mobile app for
        Android&trade; that gets parking availability information from its
        users, so that drivers can conveniently find parking when coming to
        work or driving into town. Car park operators (such as cities,
        employers, and private car parks) can make sure their car parks are
        well covered.</p>
        
        <p>We have car park locations from <a
        href="http://openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>, but if your car
        parks are missing, you can easily add them in <span
        class="appname">ParkJam</span>. We also have bits of information
        about car parks (e.g. parking fees, opening hours etc.) and again,
        you can easily add or fix them. Drivers will appreciate it.</p>
