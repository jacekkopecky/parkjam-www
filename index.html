    /></a>The best way to find parking is to know beforehand
    where the spaces are. With&nbsp;<span class="appname">ParkJam</span>,&nbsp;we can
    let each other know about the available car parks.</p>

    <div class="wide">
        <p><span class="appname">ParkJam</span> is a mobile app for
        Android&trade; that gets parking availability information from its
        users, so that we can all conveniently find parking when coming to
        work or driving into town. When you find some car park is full, it's
        real easy to tell others about it.</p>
        
        <p>We have car park locations from <a
        href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>, and if any car
        parks are missing, you can easily add them in <span
        class="appname">ParkJam</span>. We also have bits of information
        about car parks (e.g. parking fees, opening hours etc.) and again,
        you can easily add or fix them.</p>

        <h3>frequently asked questions</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>&mdash;&thinsp;Why should I be among the first to use <span
          class="appname">ParkJam</span>?</dt>
            <dd>Frankly, we do not have many users yet, but even in places
            where no-one informs us about parking availability yet, the app
            can find car parks where you're driving and often it has some
            information about them. And if you start submitting availability
            (it's so easy), others will notice it and soon you'll know about
            full car parks.
            </dd>
          <dt>&mdash;&thinsp;Can <span class="appname">ParkJam</span> tell me
          the number of available spaces?</dt>
            <dd>Unfortunately, no. We can't ask <span
            class="appname">ParkJam</span> users to count available spaces,
            and we can't have every single driver tell us where they park.
            </dd>
          <dt>&mdash;&thinsp;Will <span class="appname">ParkJam</span> lead
          me to the available space?</dt>
            <dd><span class="appname">ParkJam</span> only works with car
            parks, so it can only tell you whether the whole car park is
            expected to have spaces or to be full. If the app gets it wrong,
            make sure to let it know.
