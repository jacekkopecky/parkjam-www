After months of hard work on preparation and testing, Milton Keynes City
Council adopted ParkJam and started officially promoting it — see <a
href="http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/mkparking/">their website</a>.

<!--more-->

<p>For this to happen, we have ensured accurate information about car parks in
central Milton Keynes. Of course, the app has a global coverage of car park
locations, imported from the volunteer mapping project OpenStreetMap.org, and
ParkJam users can easily add any car parks that are missing, or any useful
information about those car parks.
</p>

<p>In Milton Keynes, we have information about parking availability from the
city centre's electronic traffic monitoring system, but still the main point
of ParkJam is to get availability reports from drivers themselves — anyone
can report full/available car parks with just a tap on the screen.
