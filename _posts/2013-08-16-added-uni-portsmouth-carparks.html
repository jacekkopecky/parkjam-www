ParkJam now also covers university car parks in Portsmouth, some of which can be used by the public in the evenings and on weekends.

<p>Have you submitted a car park, too? Tell us about it <a
href="https://facebook.com/parkjamapp/">on Facebook</a> or <a
href="https://twitter.com/parkjamapp/">on Twitter</a>; we have had
many submissions (most recently in London, near Bristol, and in Ely) but
since ParkJam doesn't have log in yet, we don't know who did it. </p>
